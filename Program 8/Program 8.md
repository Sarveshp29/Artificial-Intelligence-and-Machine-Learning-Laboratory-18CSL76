### Program 8
# Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print â€¨both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem

- K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique
- K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data
- It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset
### Algorithm
```
1)  Select the K number of neighbors
2)  Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors
3)  Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance
4)  Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category
5)  Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum
6)  K Nearest Neighbor model is ready
```

### Program
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn import datasets

iris_dataset = datasets.load_iris()
print("Iris dataset is loaded successfully")
print("***********************************")

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris_dataset.data, iris_dataset.target, test_size=0.1)

for i in range(len(iris_dataset.target_names)):
    print("Label", i, "->", str(iris_dataset.target_names[i]))

print("***********************************")

KNNClassifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=2)
KNNClassifier.fit(x_train, y_train)
y_pred = KNNClassifier.predict(x_test)

print("Result of the Classification using KNN with K=1")
print("-----------------------------------------------")
for r in range(0, len(x_test)):
    print("Sample:", str(x_test[r]), "Actual Label:", str(y_test[r]), "Predicted Label:", str(y_pred[r]))
    print("Classification Accuracy:", KNNClassifier.score(x_test, y_test))
    print("----------------------------------------------------------------")
