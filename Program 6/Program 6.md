### Program 6
# Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets

### Algorithm
- Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem.
- Bayes theorem is used to determine probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge
```math
P(A|B) = \frac {P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
```
- It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the bases of the probabilty of an object
```
1) Convert the data set into the frequency table
2) Generate likelihood table by finding the probabilities of given features
3) Use Bayes theorem to calculate the probability
```

### Program
```python
#import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
import warnings

# Load Data from CSV
data = pd.read_csv('tennisdata.csv')
print("The first 5 Values of data is :\n", data.head())

# obtain train data and train output
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
print("\nThe First 5 values of the train data is\n", X.head())

y = data.iloc[:, -1]
print("\nThe First 5 values of train output is\n", y.head())

# convert them in numbers
le_outlook = LabelEncoder()
X.Outlook = le_outlook.fit_transform(X.Outlook)

le_Temperature = LabelEncoder()
X.Temperature = le_Temperature.fit_transform(X.Temperature)

le_Humidity = LabelEncoder()
X.Humidity = le_Humidity.fit_transform(X.Humidity)

le_Windy = LabelEncoder()
X.Windy = le_Windy.fit_transform(X.Windy)

print("\nNow the Train output is\n", X.head())

le_PlayTennis = LabelEncoder()
y = le_PlayTennis.fit_transform(y)
print("\nNow the Train output is\n",y)

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size = 0.20)

classifier = GaussianNB()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Accuracy is:", accuracy_score(classifier.predict(X_test), y_test))
```

### Result
```
The first 5 Values of data is :
     Outlook Temperature Humidity   Windy PlayTennis
0     Sunny         Hot     High    Weak         No
1     Sunny         Hot     High  Strong         No
2  Overcast         Hot     High    Weak        Yes
3      Rain        Mild     High    Weak        Yes
4      Rain        Cool   Normal    Weak        Yes

The First 5 values of the train data is
     Outlook Temperature Humidity   Windy
0     Sunny         Hot     High    Weak
1     Sunny         Hot     High  Strong
2  Overcast         Hot     High    Weak
3      Rain        Mild     High    Weak
4      Rain        Cool   Normal    Weak

The First 5 values of train output is
0     No
1     No
2    Yes
3    Yes
4    Yes
Name: PlayTennis, dtype: object

Now the Train output is
    Outlook  Temperature  Humidity  Windy
0        2            1         0      1
1        2            1         0      0
2        0            1         0      1
3        1            2         0      1
4        1            0         1      1

Now the Train output is
 [0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0]
Accuracy is: 1.0
